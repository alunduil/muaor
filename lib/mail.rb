# == Description
# MUAOR is a high level set of interactive objects for a network accessible
# mail services (i.e. IMAP, POP, Exchange, etc).  Currently, only IMAP is
# available but future versions will be able to support other protocols.
#
# Mail extends the capabilities of internal libraries (i.e. Net::IMAP) and does
# not look to replace them for low level interaction.  What MUAOR tries to
# accomplish is the resource view of a MUA.  This can be extended into an IMAP
# proxy, an over-the-network procmail replacement, a full blown MUA with a
# custom interface, or it can be used as is as an irb MUA.
#
# == Objects
# The objects provided by MUAOR are the following:
# * Server
# * Mailbox
# * Message
#
# These resource looking objects map directly to the upstream mail
# implementation commands and allow interesting interactions like those shown
# in the examples below.
#
# == Examples
# === Logging In
#
#   require 'mail'
#
#   mail = Server.new(:imap, "example.com", "username", "password", :MECHANISM)
#
# === Listing Mailboxes
#
#   require 'mail'
#
#   mail = Server.new(:imap, "example.com", "username", "password", :MECHANISM)
#   mail.mailboxes.each { |mb| p mb }
#
# === Listing Particular Mailboxes
#
#   require 'mail'
#
#   mail = Server.new(:imap, "example.com", "username", "password", :MECHANISM)
#   mail.mailboxes("Example Folder*", "INBOX").each { |mb| p mb }
#
# === Listing Message Properties for Messages in a Mailbox
#
#   require 'mail'
#   require 'date'
#
#   mail = Server.new(:imap, "example.com", "username", "password", :MECHANISM)
#   mail.mailboxes("INBOX").each do |mb|
#     mb.messages.each { |m| p m.headers(:subject) }
#   end
#
