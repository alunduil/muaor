    # === Synopsis
    #
    #   Mail::Server.new(host, username, password, kwargs)
    #
    # === Arguments
    #
    # +host+::
    #   Hostname to connect to (String)
    # +username+::
    #   Username to connect with (String)
    # +password+::
    #   Password to connect with (String)
    # +kwargs+::
    #   Other optional arguments.  Meaningful values are:
    # * :method::
    #   The authentication method to sign in with.  Default :login
    # * :tls::
    #   Use TLS or SSL? Default true
    #
    # === Description
    #
    # Connect to the mail (IMAP) service at +host+ authenticating with
    # +username+ and +password+.

    # === Synopsis
    #   
    #   Mail::Server.dup
    #
    # === Description
    #
    # Duplicates the server object and ensures that a new connection comes with
    # the cloned instance.  Multi-connection situations can thus be created
    # with the following idea:
    #
    #   a = Mail::Server.new(host, username, password)
    #   b = a.dup
    #
    # All operations on a and b will be rectified by the server as part of the 
    # underlying mail implementation.

    #   globs understand the '%' and '*' globs.  The '*' matches zero or more
    #   characters, including the server's mailbox delimiter and the '%'
    #   matches zero or more characters, _not_ including the server's mailbox
    #   delimiter.  Zero or more globs can be passed to filter out mailboxes
    #   of interest.
    #
    # === Description
    #
    # Return the matched mailboxes for the globs passed (if no globs are passed
    # this returns all mailboxes.  Can be passed a block to perform an action
    # on the selected mailboxes but if no block is given returns an array of 
    # mailboxes [Mail::Mailbox].
